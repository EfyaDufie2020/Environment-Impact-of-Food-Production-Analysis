# 🌍 Environment Impact of Food Production Analysis  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
Food production is one of the leading causes of environmental degradation, contributing to **climate change, water scarcity, land degradation, and biodiversity loss**. The environmental footprint of agricultural activities varies based on **food type, farming practices, and geographic location**.  

This project aims to analyze the **environmental impact of food production** by examining key metrics such as:  
- **Carbon emissions**  
- **Water usage**  
- **Land use**  
- **Biodiversity loss**  

By leveraging **data analytics and visualization**, we seek to uncover patterns, assess sustainability challenges, and provide **data-driven recommendations** for policymakers, environmentalists, food producers, and consumers.
