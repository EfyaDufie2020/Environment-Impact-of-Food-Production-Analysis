    "### Business Understanding  \n",
    "The environmental impact of food production is a critical global issue, affecting climate change, water scarcity, and biodiversity. As food demand rises with population growth and economic development, the challenge is to produce food sustainably while minimizing negative environmental consequences. This project seeks to analyze the environmental footprint of different food products and identify ways to reduce their impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective/Goals \n",
    "- Assess the environmental impact of food production across various stages (e.g., land use, water usage, carbon emissions).  \n",
    "- Identify the most and least sustainable food products based on environmental factors.  \n",
    "- Provide data-driven insights to support policymakers, businesses, and consumers in making informed decisions.  \n",
    "- Recommend strategies to reduce the environmental footprint of food production.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement  \n",
    "Food production contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and deforestation. However, the environmental impact varies across food types and production methods. Without proper analysis, policymakers, businesses, and consumers lack the insights needed to adopt more sustainable food choices. This project aims to quantify and analyze the environmental impact of food production to guide sustainable practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders \n",
    "- **Government and policymakers** – To develop regulations and policies for sustainable food production.  \n",
    "- **Agricultural and food industries** – To adopt environmentally friendly farming and production techniques.  \n",
    "- **Consumers** – To make informed choices about sustainable food consumption.  \n",
    "- **Environmental organizations** – To advocate for sustainable food systems.  \n",
    "- **Researchers and data scientists** – To further study the impact of food production on the environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Features (Key Data Points)  \n",
    "1. Land use change (Kg CO₂-equivalents per kg product)  \n",
    "2. Animal feed (Kg CO₂-equivalents per kg product)  \n",
    "3. Farm emissions (Kg CO₂-equivalents per kg product)  \n",
    "4. Processing emissions (Kg CO₂-equivalents per kg product)  \n",
    "5. Transport emissions (Kg CO₂-equivalents per kg product)  \n",
    "6. Packaging emissions (Kg CO₂-equivalents per kg product)  \n",
    "7. Retail emissions (Kg CO₂-equivalents per kg product)  \n",
    "8. Water usage per kg of food  \n",
    "9. Impact on eutrophication (water pollution due to excess nutrients)  \n",
    "10. Biodiversity impact  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis  \n",
    "1. **Animal-based food production has a higher environmental footprint than plant-based food.**  \n",
    "2. **Transport emissions significantly contribute to the total carbon footprint of food production.**  \n",
    "3. **Processed foods have a higher carbon footprint due to additional energy consumption.**  \n",
    "4. **Local food production results in lower transport-related emissions.**  \n",
    "5. **Higher land use change values correlate with higher biodiversity loss.**  \n",
    "6. **Water-intensive crops contribute more to water scarcity issues.**  \n",
    "7. **Sustainable farming methods (e.g., organic, regenerative agriculture) result in lower environmental impact.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7 Analytical Questions  \n",
    "1. Which food products have the highest and lowest carbon emissions?  \n",
    "2. How does the environmental impact of animal-based foods compare to plant-based foods?  \n",
    "3. What is the correlation between land use change and biodiversity loss?  \n",
    "4. Which stage of food production (farm, processing, transport, packaging, retail) contributes the most to carbon emissions?  \n",
    "5. How does food transportation distance affect total emissions?  \n",
    "6. Which foods contribute the most to eutrophication (water pollution)?  \n",
    "7. What are the most sustainable food options based on environmental impact metrics?  \n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach will help extract actionable insights from the dataset, supporting sustainable decision-making in food production and consumption."
